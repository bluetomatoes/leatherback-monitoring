Questions for Erik:

-Why do we need a Raspberry Pi as an intermediary for this? Why can't we just connect to a computer?
-How do you get data? Like if I want to experiment by playing around with a light sensor, how do I do that? Can it read analog?
-What does time synchronization mean? Is it that we're getting absolute values from when the sensor is turned on?
-What format are we going to be getting data in? Same as the DHT? (i probably can figure this out?)
